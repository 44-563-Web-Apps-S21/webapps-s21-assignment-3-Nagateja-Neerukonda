    <h4>Watching Movies</h4>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5em;margin-right: 2.5em;">I love watching movie. It can make us be fun. We can spend our
        leisure time watching movie. We can do it by
        ourselves or with our <b>Friends</b>. It can be an enjoyable activity. Watching movie can also give some
        information for us. Some films tell us about the important event.Watching movie is my best way to spend my
        leisure time. It can refresh my mind. If I felt sad, watching a
        cartoon or commedy film can entertain my self. Watching movie in the cinema is more interesting. I usually do
        that with my <b>family</b> or my friends.</p>
